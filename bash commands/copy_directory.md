## To copy a folder in Bash, you can use the `cp` command with the `-r` (recursive) option. Here's the basic syntax:

```sh
cp -r <source_folder> <destination_folder>
```

Explanation:

- `cp`: The command for copying files and directories.
- `-r`: The option to copy directories recursively, including all subdirectories and files.
- `<source_folder>`: The path to the folder you want to copy.
- `<destination_folder>`: The path to the location where you want to copy the folder.
